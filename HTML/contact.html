          <p>If the Page doesn't show anything, but the yellow background in the center and the red blocks that is because scripts for this page are disabled, however don't panic and stay organic , cuz
          you can turn it on at the top right by the link by clicking on whatever there is it's by star to bookmark stuff and blick enable scripts for this page. Don't know why it's acting weird anyway you can send me emails here suggesting what i should add and whatnot and it is completely anonymous. Have fun but please don't spam too much thanks .</p>
